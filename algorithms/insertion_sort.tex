Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm. Unfortunately, insertion sort is much less efficient  when 
compared to quick sort, heap sort, and merge sort. There are some advantages to insertion sort though:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item easy to implement,
	\item performs well on small sets,
	\item adaptive--better on partially sorted sets,
	\item stable--doesn't change the relative order of the same keys,
	\item in place additional memory, \(\theta(1)\), and
	\item online--can be sorted as values received.
\end{enumerate}
How do we measure complexity for insertion sort? In the best case, it would take linear time to run 
through a sorted array, \(\theta(n)\). In general, if we are inserting into a subarray with \(k\) elements, all
\(k\) elements may have to shift over one unit. Let's say a comparison cost \(c\). It could take up to 
\(c\cdot k\) to insert into a subarray of \(k\) elements. If we were inserting into this array a value that is 
always less than every element, the index of \(k_0\) would be at one the first time, two, three, ..., \(n - 1\).
The total time spend would be
\[
	c + 2\cdot c + 3\cdot c + \cdots + (n - 1)\cdot c = c\cdot (1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + (n - 1)).
\]
We can see we have an arithmetic series where \(a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)\cdot c\) where \(c\) is the common
difference between elements. The sum of this series is
\begin{align*}
	S_n & = \frac{n}{2}[2\cdot a_1 + a_n]\\
	& = \frac{n}{2}[2\cdot c + c\cdot(n - 1 + 1)]\\
	&= \frac{c\cdot n^2}{2} + c\cdot n
\end{align*}
Thus, we have \(\theta(n^2)\).
\begin{python}
def insertion_sort(array: List[int]) -> None:
  for idx in range(1, len(array)):
    curr = array[idx]
    curr_idx = idx
    
    while curr_idx > 0 and array[curr_idx - 1] > curr:
      array[curr_idx] = array[curr_idx - 1]
      curr_idx = curr_idx - 1
      
    array[curr_idx] = curr
\end{python}
